<h1>www.gstat.org</h1>
Whether planned or not, you just landed at www.gstat.org. This
domain was the main point for the gstat project, which started
in 1993, open sourced in 1997, got a website a bit before 2000,
then remained in Utrecht, where it was taken down in 2014 because
it fell victim to botnet attacks.

<h2>Citing gstat</h2>
There are two gstat citations:
<ul>
<li>Pebesma, E.J., 2004. Multivariable geostatistics in S: the gstat package. Computers & Geosciences 30 (7), 683-691
<li> Pebesma, E.J. and C.G. Wesseling, 1998. Gstat, a program for geostatistical modelling, prediction and simulation. Computers & Geosciences 24 (1), 17-31.
</ul>

<h2>where is gstat?</h2>
The gstat project started as a source code base from which one
could compile a binary executable that could carry out geostatistical
computations. It started reading and writing pcraster files, then
other file formats were added, until it was linked to the
<a href="http://www.gdal.org/">gdal</a> library.
<p>

Since the gstat <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/package=gstat">package</a> was published
in 2003, development in gstat standalone was constrained to bug fixes only.
Of course both projects share a large C code base, but all 
new features happened in R, and no support e.g. for compiling 
binaries of gstat standalone took place.

<h2>time for retirement?</h2>
I don't see any ground to continue development of the gstat standalone
program, and as such it can be considered as retired. Manual and sources of
the original program are still provided. 

<h2>manual</h2>
Here, you'll find the gstat stand alone
<a href="gstat.pdf">pdf</a> manual.

<h2>source code</h2>
The tar ball of the source code is <a href="gstat.tar.gz">here</a>
